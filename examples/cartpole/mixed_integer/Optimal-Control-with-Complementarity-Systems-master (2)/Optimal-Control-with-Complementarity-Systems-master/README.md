# Optimal Control with Complementarity Systems
1. Problem Formulation <br />
2. Methods <br />
3. Papers <br />

## Problem Formulation
Concrete problem formulation, we can refine it as we move forward.

## Methods
Clear description of the methods and evaluation of how effective they are based on simulations.
1. Definition of the method/algorithm
2. Code (MATLAB for now)

## Papers
Things to pay attention to while reading the paper: 
1. What problem are they exactly solving in the paper?
2. How are they solving the problem? What is the novel idea in the paper? What is interesting about their approach?
3. What are the tools/methods they use in the paper to achieve their goal?
4. Other important things that does not fit in 1,2,3 but seems like important to note down. <br />
Note: Few keywords for each 1,2,3,(4) so it is easy to follow.
